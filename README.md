# What It Is
You’ve definitely played Flappy Bird before, right?
And I’m sure you’ve also spent some time in Dota 2.

Now imagine this:
You are a tiny, fragile Void Spirit stuck in the mid lane…
Dodging an aggressive Slardar, trying desperately to survive for 3 minutes！

# Build Story (AI Tools)
This project evolved in stages using multiple AI tools and platforms:
1. **GitHub Pages (legacy):** The first version was a small playable prototype deployed on GitHub Pages.
2. **Stitch:** Generated the initial page layouts.
3. **Figma:** Refined the visual design and layout details.
4. **AI Studio:** Converted the design into an interactive frontend.
5. **Supabase:** Added authentication, profiles, scores, and leaderboard data.
6. **Vercel:** Deployed the full production build with login + leaderboard.
